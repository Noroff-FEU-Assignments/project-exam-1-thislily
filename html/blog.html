              It's finally 2074! The world outside may be a shadow of its former
              self, post-climate disaster, but inside my small abode, hope and
              positivity reign. I've learned to find beauty in the midst of
              decay, cherishing each new day as a gift. My morning begins in

            I'm Persephone, your guide to thriving in post-apocalyptic 2074.
            Named after the goddess who symbolizes rebirth, I embody resilience
            in our new reality. Growing up before the climate cataclysm, I've
            learned to find beauty amidst desolation, much like Persephone's
            return brings spring. My life revolves around sustainable, stylish
            livingâ€”from upcycled fashion to vegan delights in my solar kitchen.
            Here, I share tips for living beautifully with gas masks, and how to
            keep spirits high with bunker parties. Join me in discovering joy
            and resilience in the smallest moments, lighting our path with
            optimism and love.
